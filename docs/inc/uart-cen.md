	"CEN" pin is the RESET pin - connecting it to GND will keep the chip in "reset" state. Disconnecting it will allow the chip to start back up.

	If you're having issues with using CEN pin (or if it's not accessible on your device) you can toggle the 3.3V power instead. Removing power will keep it in "reset", and applying it back will start it again.
